## üîß Description of `BPF_BUTTERWORTH` Block

### Module: `BPF_BUTTERWORTH`

This module implements a Butterworth band-pass filter using a Laplace-domain transfer function.

### Parameters
- `wo` (double): Center angular frequency in radians/second  
- `in` (double): Input signal  
- `out` (double): Filtered output signal

### Transfer Function

- **Numerator**: (W √ó 2œÄ / 0.7) √ó s  
- **Denominator**: s¬≤ + ((2œÄW)/0.7) √ó s + (2œÄW)¬≤

Where:
- *s*: Complex Laplace variable  
- *W*: Center frequency  
- *Ts*: Integration or sampling time constant

The 1/0.7 factor adjusts the filter bandwidth to achieve a smooth Butterworth response.

### Functionality
1. Receives input signal `in`
2. Applies the defined band-pass filtering
3. Outputs the filtered signal as `out`

## üõ†Ô∏è About CppSim

CppSim is a simulation environment for analog and digital systems. It is particularly well-suited for developing and testing communication front-ends and circuit-level blocks.

To install CppSim:
1. Visit [cppsim.com](https://www.cppsim.com/download.html)
2. Download and unzip the package
3. Follow the platform-specific installation guide
4. Ensure you have a C++ compiler and required dependencies

### Integrating a Custom Block
To add your own block:
1. Create a new C++ file containing your logic
2. Add it to the CppSim project and connect via signal definitions
3. Compile and run the simulation to validate functionality
