Juan C. Garcia Gutierrez:

He was born in Puebla, 1997. He received the B.Sc. degree in mechatronics engineering from Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla (BUAP) in 2021. He collaborated in the characterization of chips at the Circuits and Systems Characterization Laboratory, Faculty of Electronics. At the time, he is studying the M.Sc. degree from Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla (BUAP). His research interests are systems radio frequency design for wireless communications.

Victor Rodolfo Gonzalez Diaz

He was born in Mexico. He received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the National Institute of
Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics (INAOE),
Puebla, Mexico, in 2005 and 2009, respectively.
He collaborated as a Postdoctoral Fellow with
the Microsystems Laboratory, University of Pavia,
Italy, from 2009 to 2010. He has been a full-time
Professor with the Faculty of Electronics, BUAP,
Puebla, since 2011. He is currently the Founder
and the Head of the Circuits and Systems Characterization Laboratory,
Faculty of Electronics. His research interests include the design of analog
and mixed-signal integrated circuits focusing on analog-to-digital converter
design, frequency synthesizers, and micropower management circuits.
He participates as an Associate Editor of IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS
AND SYSTEMS—II: EXPRESS BRIEFS.

Luis A. Sanchez Gasparino
He received the PhD degree in Electronics Sciences from the Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica, Óptica y Electrónica (INAOE), Puebla, Mexico, in 2011. His doctoral work was on the subject of CMOS Power Amplifiers for wireless communications. During 2009 he was a visiting scholar in the Integrated Circuits Design (ICD) group at the University of Twente, in the Netherlands. In 2011 he joined the Electronics and Telecommunications department at the Universidad Politécnica de Puebla, in Puebla, Mexico, where he served as the head of the Electronics group for about seven years. Since 2017 to date, he is with the Electronics Faculty at Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla (BUAP), in Puebla, Mexico, as a full professor and member of the Photonics and Nanooptics Systems research group. He is a regular member (level-1) of the National Systems for Researchers (SNI), which is a top‐level program founded by the Mexican Government through the National Council of Human Studies, Science and Technology (CONAHCyT) from Mexico. He has published over 60 scientific works and regularly serves as a reviewer for high-impact journals. His research focuses on Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools, analog, mixed-mode, and RF circuit design, and next-generation wireless systems like IoT and 5G, particularly in automotive applications.

CppSim is a simulation tool for modeling analog and digital systems, especially useful for the development and analysis of electronic circuits and communication front-ends. It facilitates the integration of behavioral models and enables accurate simulations in design environments such as Virtuoso.

To install CppSim, download the package from its official website or repository (https://www.cppsim.com/download.html), unzip the file, and follow the instructions specific to your operating system. Make sure you have a C++-compatible compiler and the necessary dependencies for the simulation installed.

To integrate a code block into CppSim, create a new C++ source file with the block's logic, then include it in the project and connect it to other modules via the defined signals. Compile the project and run the simulation to verify the behavior of the integrated block.
