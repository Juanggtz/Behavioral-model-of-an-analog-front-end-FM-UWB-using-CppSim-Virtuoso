# Behavioral-model-of-an-analog-front-end-FM-UWB-using-CppSim-Virtuoso

This repository has the codes used for the a behavioral model of transceiver FM-UWB, the authores in the system

CppSim is a simulation tool for modeling analog and digital systems, especially useful for the development and analysis of electronic circuits and communication front-ends. It facilitates the integration of behavioral models and enables accurate simulations in design environments such as Virtuoso.

To install CppSim, download the package from its official website or repository (https://www.cppsim.com/download.html), unzip the file, and follow the instructions specific to your operating system. Make sure you have a C++-compatible compiler and the necessary dependencies for the simulation installed.

To integrate a code block into CppSim, create a new C++ source file with the block's logic, then include it in the project and connect it to other modules via the defined signals. Compile the project and run the simulation to verify the behavior of the integrated block.
